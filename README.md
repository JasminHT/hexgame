A 4X game with no waiting. Closer to CivClicker than Civilization.

Initially intended as a learning experiment for both HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.
Now also helping me learn to use Git better.

The game will be self-explanatory later, for now you just have to know.

How to play so far:
# Settler
* Blue and pink square is a settler.
* Click him to select him.
* Click inside his range to move.
* Don't run out of food!
* Put him on the yellow dots to get more food.

# Towns
* Click him again to turn into a town.
* You need 10 wood to do so.
* Put him on brown dots to get more food.
* Towns can make settlers if they have 30 food.
* Select them and click inside their range to do so.
* Towns can grow bigger if they have 30 wood.
* Select them and click them again to do so.

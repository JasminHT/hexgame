A 4X game with no waiting. Closer to CivClicker than Civilization.

Initially intended as a learning experiment for HTML5 Canvas and Javascript.
Now also helping me learn to use Github actions better.

The game will have better onboarding later, for now you just have to know.

How to play so far:

Drag with the mouse or finger to move the screen.
Use the scroll wheel or pinch to zoom.


The numbered tile in the middle is your base.
Click it once to show the range of movement (in brown).
Hover your mouse within the range to see where you can place a node.
Each node costs 2 dots, but gathers all dots in range.
Click again on a node to grow its collection range.
Nodes also expand your range.
The central node shows your dot supply, try and increase it by placing nodes that gather more dots than they cost.

This will eventually be communicated through the game interface.

Seed action can launch to other planets. Zoom out a bit.

Try and click the same tile a few dozen times to see cool visuals.
